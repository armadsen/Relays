Relays
======

This project is a simple demonstration application for communicating with a custom 16-channel relay board. It was created for a presentation about ORSSerialPort and writing Cocoa programs that communicate with custom hardware at [SLC CocoaHeads](http://www.saltlakecocoaheads.org) on October 2, 2012.
